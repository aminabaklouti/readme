## The dataset
The [dataset](https://pavis.iit.it/index.php/datasets/autism-spectrum-disorder-detection-dataset) contains trials performed by both autistic  and normal Kids.
The Main task is to perform this two-class classification.

## The code 
This repo is based on [this public code](https://github.com/kracwarlock/action-recognition-visual-attention) implementing an [attention-based LSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04119v3) and is meant to classify autistic kids from the kinematics of motion. It contains:
- matlab scripts for estracting CNN features from the video frames (GoogleNet - Caffe) 
- python scripts for the actual LSTM training (theano)
